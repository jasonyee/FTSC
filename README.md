# FTSC
Functional Time Series Clustering

This is a summer project I am working on at the biostatistics department in Perelman school of medicine, University of Pennsylvania.

I am very fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. Richard Landis and Prof. Wensheng Guo.

The aim of the project is to classify the time series data collected from the patients to make statistical inference.

# Version: v1.01

This is the version with:

*  dss_uni2step (so called dss2 in communicating)
*  parellel computing in DSSClustering
*  fast fmeCondProb
*  fast state space model construction

This version is a time-variant version.
