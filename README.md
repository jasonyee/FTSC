# FTSC
Functional Time Series Clustering

This is a summer project I am working on at the biostatistics department in Perelman school of medicine, University of Pennsylvania.

I am very fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. Richard Landis and Prof. Wensheng Guo.

The aim of the project is to classify the time series data collected from the patients to make statistical inference.

# Features

This is the version with:

*  numerical stable filtering and smoothing algorithm for time-variant state space model
*  functional mixed effect model for periodic data
*  allow missing data
*  functional clustering on time series data
*  choosing optimal number of clusters

# Demo

## Simulatated data
