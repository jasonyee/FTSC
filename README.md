# FTSC
Functional Time Series Clustering

This is a summer project I am working on at the biostatistics department in Perelman school of medicine, University of Pennsylvania.

I am very fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. Richard Landis and Prof. Wensheng Guo.

The aim of the project is to classify the time series data collected from the patients to make statistical inference.

# Features

This is the version with:

*  numerical stable filtering and smoothing
*  time-variant model
*  balanced time points for all subjects.
*  dss2step algorithm
*  parellel computing in DSSClustering
*  fast fmeCondProb
*  fast state space model construction
